Natural yeast. The process of creating natural yeast, also known as a sourdough starter, involves mixing flour and water together and allowing it to ferment over a period of time. The timeline for creating a sourdough starter can vary, but typically it takes around 5-7 days.


1.  Day 1: In a large mixing bowl, combine equal parts flour and water (such as 100g each) and mix until well combined. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let it sit at room temperature for 24 hours.
    
2.  Day 2: Discard half of the mixture and add in an equal amount of flour and water. Mix well and cover again with a clean kitchen towel. Let sit for another 24 hours.
    
3.  Day 3-5: Repeat the process of discarding half of the mixture and adding in equal parts flour and water each day. The mixture should start to become bubbly and active, indicating that fermentation is occurring.
    
4.  Day 6: The mixture should be visibly bubbly and have a sour smell. This is the point where the starter is ready to use. It can be stored in the refrigerator and fed with flour and water every few days to keep it active.


Tips:

1.  Use a mixture of different types of flour, such as whole wheat or rye flour, for added flavor and nutrition.
2.  Keep your starter in a warm and draft-free place (around 75F) while it's fermenting
3.  Use filtered or unchlorinated water
4.  Use a clean spoon or your hand to stir the mixture
5.  Keep your starter in a glass container to observe the progress
6.  Be patient, it takes time for the yeast to build up
7.  Keep a small amount of the mixture for future use
8.  If you are not using the starter for a while keep it in the fridge and feed it once a week
9.  If your starter doesn't seem to be active after a few days, discard it and start over
10.  always use clean equipment and work surface

Safety considerations:

1.  Clean all equipment and work surfaces thoroughly before starting.
2.  Be aware that the mixture may attract fruit flies, so it's best to cover the bowl with a lid or plastic wrap.
3.  If the mixture starts to smell sour or moldy, discard it and start over
4.  Keep your starter in a clean and safe place.

Equipments:

1.  Large mixing bowl
2.  Spoon or spatula


## Explain the step-by-step process of making fresh yeast based on the “Starter” method

The process of making fresh yeast using the starter method is a bit different from the traditional method I previously described. Here are the steps for creating a yeast starter:

1.  In a small container or jar, mix together equal parts flour and warm water (around 110-115°F). You can use any type of flour, but wheat flour is typically recommended.
    
2.  Cover the container with a lid or plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature for 24 hours.
    
3.  After 24 hours, you should see bubbles forming on the surface of the mixture and a sour smell. This indicates that wild yeast is present and your starter is active.
    
4.  Discard half of the mixture and add equal parts flour and warm water to the remaining starter. Stir it well and cover again.
    
5.  Repeat step 4 every 24 hours for about a week or until the starter is consistently bubbly and active.
    
6.  Once your starter is established, you can use it to make your dough. The amount of starter you use will depend on the recipe, but it is usually around 10-20% of the total flour used.
    
7.  Keep your starter in a cool place, ideally around 65-75°F, or in the refrigerator and feed it regularly (once a week or so) to maintain its strength.
    

It's important to note that the process of creating a yeast starter may take longer than the traditional method and requires regular attention and maintenance. The result is different than the traditional yeast and it's considered as a healthier way to make yeast. Also, the taste is slightly different, and the process is considered more natural.



Yes, there are other ways to make traditional fresh yeast Italian style, specifically for Neapolitan pizza dough. One popular method is the "Mother Yeast" or "Mother Starter" method. This method involves creating a small batch of yeast and flour mixture, called a "sponge," that is allowed to ferment for several days. Once the sponge has fermented, a portion of it is saved and used to create the next batch of dough. This process is repeated over time, with the "Mother Yeast" constantly being refreshed and maintained.

Here is a step-by-step process for making traditional fresh yeast using the Mother Yeast method:

1.  In a mixing bowl, combine 1 cup of flour (preferably Italian "00" flour or a blend of "00" and bread flour) and 1/4 teaspoon of active dry yeast.
    
2.  Slowly add 1/2 cup of lukewarm water, stirring until the mixture forms a thick paste.
    
3.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the mixture sit at room temperature for 12-24 hours.
    
4.  After the initial fermentation period, add 1/2 cup of flour and 1/4 cup of water to the mixture, stirring until well combined.
    
5.  Cover the bowl again and let it sit at room temperature for another 12-24 hours.
    
6.  Repeat the process of adding flour and water every 12-24 hours for up to 5 days, or until the mixture is bubbly and has a strong, sour aroma.
    
7.  Once the Mother Yeast is ready, use a portion of it (about 1/4 cup) to make your pizza dough, and save the rest for future use. Keep in mind that the Mother Yeast should be refreshed regularly, so make sure to add more flour and water to it periodically, and keep it in the refrigerator when not in use.
    

Tips and Tricks:

-   Use a thermometer to check the temperature of the water, it should be between 75-80F.
-   Use a wooden spoon to mix the ingredients, it will help to keep the dough at the right temperature.
-   Keep the dough in a warm place around 75-80F and away from drafts.
-   Always use a container that is big enough to allow the dough to rise at least 2-3 times the size.
-   Keep your hands and tools clean all the time, to prevent contamination of the dough

Safety considerations:

-   Keep your hands and tools clean all the time, to prevent contamination of the dough
-   Make sure to use only the freshest ingredients and avoid any expired ingredients
-   Take care when handling hot ovens or other kitchen equipment
-   Always use oven mitts or other protective gear when handling hot items in the kitchen.
